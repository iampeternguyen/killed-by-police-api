A simple API to get data from killedbypolice.net

This project scraped data from kbp.net to store it in a mongoDB database.

Users can get data by sending requests to

https://killed-by-police-api.herokuapp.com/

https://killed-by-police-api.herokuapp.com/data will return all the data (warning can be very slow)

https://killed-by-police-api.herokuapp.com/2013 will return data from 2013

Data currently exists from 2013-2018.

The original creator of killedbypolice.net has unfortunately stopped collecting data. Although recently I found that the Washington Post has it's own data here. https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/police-shootings-2018/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a950c59ed39d
